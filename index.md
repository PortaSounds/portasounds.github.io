# Background

Mixing and Mastering is an art that is learned through many years. Starting as a live sound audio engineer ten years ago, I wanted to move into a studio environment as the environment is different. I needed to expand my knowledge in the audio engineering field to fully understand each and every aspect of it.

Listening to songs made today, each and every one of them has a certain aspect that makes it unique. However, not a lot of producers can achieve a properly mixed or mastered song through many factors. But don't feel left out, as I'm here to assist you.
